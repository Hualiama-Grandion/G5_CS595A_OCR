The following is a step-by-step list of instructions in order to successfully use and execute the code provided in this repository. 

## Step 1 - Install Python\
You must begin by installing a compatible version of Python. In this case, the compatible version of Python is 3.11.X. The code will automatically throw an assertion error if you are not using this compatible version. 

Install python by going to (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and downloading the correct version. Make sure to add Python to the path.

## Step 2 - Install General Packages\
To run this code, you will need the following packages. Note that some packages are already included in the Python standard installation. Installation commands are provided in two formats. The first command is meant for use with cmd prompt and the second within the terminal in an editor such as VSCode. 

### Step 2.1 - Bundled with Python:\

**numpy**\
pip install numpy

py -m pip install numpy

**matplotlib**\
pip install matplotlib

py -m pip install matplotlib

**symspellpy**\
pip install symspellpy

py -m pip install symspellpy

## Step 3 - Install OCR Packages\
**paddlepaddle**\
**paddleocr**

Use the following link (https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/en/install/index_en.html) and follow the step-by-step tutorial to properly install these modules. 

> [!NOTE]
> You need to install CUDA and cuDNN from Nvidia if you plan on running this using a GPU. 

## Step 4 - Preparing your Task
Now it is time to use the code.
Note that if your machine does not possess a GPU, you will need to change a setting.
